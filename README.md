## A streamlit app that classfiies emails as spam or ham

#### To run you need to:

* Install the dependecies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* run streamlit using `streamlit run main.py`

**PS:**  The jupyter notebook is the original model training notebook, and the `main.py` python file only loads the model, and create the streamlit app.
